### About Me

I'm Isabel and I'm a data scientist at Spotify. I initially joined Spotify's ML Engagements team (Lex Beattie speaks about ML Engagements [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvwclqkEEpE)), and I now develop [insights](https://medium.com/@SpotifyInsights) for our [Machine Learning Platform](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2019/12/the-winding-road-to-better-machine-learning-infrastructure-through-tensorflow-extended-and-kubeflow/). I have also been focused on algorithmic responsibility initiatives and research at Spotify. 

Prior to working at Spotify, I interned for organizations focused on education and child welfare policy research: [InsideSchools](https://insideschools.org/about/about-us) and [Action Research Partners](https://www.actionresearch.io). I graduated with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science from Yale in 2021, where I was fortunate to have my senior thesis, which was centered around algorithmic fairness, advised by Professor Elisa Celis (Professor of Statistics & Data Science) and Professor Issa Kohler-Hausmann (Professor of law at Yale Law School). During my time at Yale I was a research assistant for projects in the [STEM PERL lab](https://stem-perl.yale.edu/) and the [Human Nature Lab](https://humannaturelab.net/).

These days, outside of work, I like to play basketball and attend [Moth StorySLAMs](https://themoth.org/about-moth-events). I'm Brooklyn bred and still based out of the best borough in NYC!
