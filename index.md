## About Me

Hello! I'm Isabel and I am a data scientist at Spotify. I initially joined Spotify's ML Engagements team (Lex Beattie speaks about ML Engagements [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvwclqkEEpE)), and I now develop [insights](https://medium.com/@SpotifyInsights) for our [Machine Learning Platform](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2019/12/the-winding-road-to-better-machine-learning-infrastructure-through-tensorflow-extended-and-kubeflow/). 

Prior to working at Spotify, I interned at [InsideSchools](https://insideschools.org/about/about-us) and [Action Research Partners](https://www.actionresearch.io). I graduated with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science from Yale in 2021, where I was fortunate to have my senior thesis advised by Professor Elisa Celis and Professor Issa Kohler-Hausmann. During my time at Yale I was a research assistant for projects in the [STEM PERL lab](https://stem-perl.yale.edu/) with [Mark Graham](https://eeb.yale.edu/people/research-scientists/mark-graham) and [Human Nature Lab](https://humannaturelab.net/) under [Navin Kumar](https://sites.google.com/view/navin-kumar).

I'm always picking up new hobbies but some consistent joys of mine include playing basketball, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/isabel_s_c_9), and attending [Moth StorySLAMs](https://themoth.org/about-moth-events). I'm Brooklyn bred and still based out of the best borough in NYC!
