Hi! I’m Isabel, and I’m a second-year Information Science PhD student at the Cornell Bowers College of Computing and Information Science. My recent work has used data science, causal inference, and online experiments to conduct socio-technical audits of algorithmic systems. I am particularly interested in measuring harms of generative AI systems on our information ecosystem, and how generative AI will impact social evaluations in online contexts. I am fortunate to be advised by [Mor Naaman](https://mmoorr.github.io/www_personal/) and [Allison Koenecke](https://koenecke.infosci.cornell.edu/), and a member of the [Artificial Intelligence, Policy, and Practice (AIPP)](https://aipp.cis.cornell.edu/) initiative at Cornell.
