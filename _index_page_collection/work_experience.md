Prior to joining Cornell's Info Sci PhD program, I worked for several years as a data scientist at Spotify. At Spotify I contributed to several to different areas of the company, including algorithmic impact and responsibility and the ML Engagements team (Lex Beattie speaks about ML Engagements [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvwclqkEEpE)).

I graduated with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science from Yale, where my senior thesis on the assumptions and ontologies of word embedding bias was advised by Professors Elisa Celis and Issa Kohler-Hausmann. While at Yale I was also a research assistant for projects in the [STEM PERL lab](https://stem-perl.yale.edu/) and the [Human Nature Lab](https://humannaturelab.net/), and interned for education ([InsideSchools](https://insideschools.org/about/about-us)) and child welfare policy research ([Action Research Partners](https://www.actionresearch.io)) organizations.
