Prior to joining the Cornell PhD program, I worked for several years as a data scientist at Spotify. At Spotify I contributed to several teams, including algorithmic impact and responsibility and the ML Engagement (Lex Beattie speaks about ML Engagement [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvwclqkEEpE)).
<!-- , and developing [insights](https://medium.com/@SpotifyInsights) for the [Machine Learning Platform](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2019/12/the-winding-road-to-better-machine-learning-infrastructure-through-tensorflow-extended-and-kubeflow/). -->

I graduated with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science from Yale, where my senior thesis on the assumptions and ontologies of word embedding bias was advised by Professor Elisa Celis (Professor of Statistics & Data Science) and Professor Issa Kohler-Hausmann (Professor of law at Yale Law School). At Yale I was a research assistant for projects in the [STEM PERL lab](https://stem-perl.yale.edu/) and the [Human Nature Lab](https://humannaturelab.net/) and interned with organizations focused on education ([InsideSchools](https://insideschools.org/about/about-us)) and child welfare policy research ([Action Research Partners](https://www.actionresearch.io)).
