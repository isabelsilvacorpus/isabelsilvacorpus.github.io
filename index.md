### About Me

I am a first-year Information Science PhD student at the Cornell Bowers College of Computing and Information Science. I am fortunate to be advised by [Mor Naaman](https://mmoorr.github.io/www_personal/) and [Allison Koenecke](https://koenecke.infosci.cornell.edu/). 

Broadly, I am interested in algorithmic fairness and computational social science. I aspire to produce research that informs efficient and equitable social policy and online platforms. 

### Work Experience 

I began my career as a data scientist at Spotify. I initially joined Spotify's ML Engagements team (Lex Beattie speaks about ML Engagements [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvwclqkEEpE)), and I now develop [insights](https://medium.com/@SpotifyInsights) for our [Machine Learning Platform](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2019/12/the-winding-road-to-better-machine-learning-infrastructure-through-tensorflow-extended-and-kubeflow/). I have also been focused on algorithmic responsibility initiatives and research at Spotify. 

Prior to working at Spotify, I interned for organizations focused on education and child welfare policy research: [InsideSchools](https://insideschools.org/about/about-us) and [Action Research Partners](https://www.actionresearch.io). I graduated with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science from Yale in 2021, where I was fortunate to have my senior thesis, which was centered around algorithmic fairness, advised by Professor Elisa Celis (Professor of Statistics & Data Science) and Professor Issa Kohler-Hausmann (Professor of law at Yale Law School). During my time at Yale I was a research assistant for projects in the [STEM PERL lab](https://stem-perl.yale.edu/) and the [Human Nature Lab](https://humannaturelab.net/).
