Prior to joining the Cornell Info Sci PhD program, I worked for several years as a data scientist at Spotify. At Spotify, I contributed to several teams, including algorithmic impact and responsibility and ML Engagement (Lex Beattie speaks about ML Engagement [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvwclqkEEpE)). 

I graduated with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science from Yale, where my senior thesis on the latent assumptions in word embedding debiasing methods was advised by Professors Elisa Celis and Issa Kohler-Hausmann. At Yale, I was a research assistant for projects in the [STEM PERL lab](https://stem-perl.yale.edu/) and the [Human Nature Lab](https://humannaturelab.net/) and interned with organizations focused on education ([InsideSchools](https://insideschools.org/about/about-us)) and child welfare policy research ([Action Research Partners](https://www.actionresearch.io)).
