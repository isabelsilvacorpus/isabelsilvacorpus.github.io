### Bio

I am a first-year Information Science PhD student at the Cornell Bowers College of Computing and Information Science. I am fortunate to be advised by [Mor Naaman](https://mmoorr.github.io/www_personal/) and [Allison Koenecke](https://koenecke.infosci.cornell.edu/). 

I am interested in using computational social science to understand forms of harm and inequity that are propagated by large scale algorithmic systems. I aspire to produce research that informs efficient and equitable social policy and online platforms. 

### Work Experience 

Prior to joining the Cornell PhD program, I worked for several years as a data scientist at Spotify. At Spotify I contributed to several to different areas of the company, including algorithmic impact and responsibility, ML Engagements team (Lex Beattie speaks about ML Engagements [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvwclqkEEpE)), and developing [insights](https://medium.com/@SpotifyInsights) for our [Machine Learning Platform](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2019/12/the-winding-road-to-better-machine-learning-infrastructure-through-tensorflow-extended-and-kubeflow/).

I graduated with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science from Yale, where my senior thesis on the assumptions and ontologies of word embedding bias was advised by Professor Elisa Celis (Professor of Statistics & Data Science) and Professor Issa Kohler-Hausmann (Professor of law at Yale Law School). At Yale I was a research assistant for projects in the [STEM PERL lab](https://stem-perl.yale.edu/) and the [Human Nature Lab](https://humannaturelab.net/). I also held data analyst internships for organizations focused on education and child welfare policy research: [InsideSchools](https://insideschools.org/about/about-us) and [Action Research Partners](https://www.actionresearch.io).
