Hi! I'm Isabel, and I'm a second-year Information Science PhD student at the Cornell Bowers College of Computing and Information Science. I use data science and computational social science methods to conduct socio-technical audits of algorithmic systems, with a particular interest in understanding potential social harms. I am fortunate to be advised by [Mor Naaman](https://mmoorr.github.io/www_personal/) and [Allison Koenecke](https://koenecke.infosci.cornell.edu/).
