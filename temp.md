## About Me

Hello! I'm Isabel and I am a data scientist at Spotify. I initially joined Spotify's ML Engagements team (Lex Beattie speaks about ML Engagements [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvwclqkEEpE)), and I now develop [insights](https://medium.com/@SpotifyInsights) for our [Machine Learning Platform](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2019/12/the-winding-road-to-better-machine-learning-infrastructure-through-tensorflow-extended-and-kubeflow/). I'm always picking up new hobbies but some consistent joys of mine include playing basketball, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/isabel_s_c_9), and attending [Moth StorySLAMs](https://themoth.org/about-moth-events). I'm a native New Yorker and am currently based out of Brooklyn.
